DevOps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The SDLC includes planning, requirements, design, development,
testing, deployment, and maintenance.

DevOps improves SDLC by adding automation and continuous feedback.


Testing:
Testing validates functionality and reduces bugs before deployment.
Automated testing helps teams detect issues earlier.


Monitoring:
After deployment, monitoring tracks performance and failures.
Feedback helps teams improve future releases.
