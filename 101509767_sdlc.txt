DevOps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) includes stages such as:
- Planning
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

DevOps improves SDLC by:
- Automating builds and testing
- Enabling continuous integration
- Reducing deployment errors
- Improving collaboration between teams

By integrating DevOps practices into SDLC, 
organizations can deliver software faster, 
with better quality and fewer failures.

Testing Phase:
Testing ensures the software functions correctly and 
meets user requirements before deployment.

Monitoring and Feedback:
After deployment, monitoring tools track performance 
and detect issues in real time.
