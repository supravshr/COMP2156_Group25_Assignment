DevOps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The SDLC includes planning, design, development,
testing, deployment, and maintenance.

DevOps improves SDLC by automating testing and deployment.


Testing:
Testing verifies that the software meets requirements.


Monitoring:
After deployment, systems are monitored for performance and errors.
