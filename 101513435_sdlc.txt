DevOps in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) includes stages such as:
- Planning
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

DevOps improves SDLC by:

By integrating DevOps practices into SDLC, 
organizations can deliver software faster, 
with better quality and fewer failures.
