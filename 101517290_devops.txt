COMP2156 DevOps Course Overview

DevOps combines development and operations to improve collaboration,
automation, and delivery speed.

In COMP2156, we learn Git, branching, pull requests, and CI concepts.

Git Workflow:
Developers create feature branches, commit changes locally,
push to GitHub, and open pull requests for review and merging.


CI/CD:
Continuous Integration automatically tests code changes.
Continuous Deployment automates releases to reduce manual work and errors.
